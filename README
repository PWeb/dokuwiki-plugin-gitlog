Git repository viewer plugin for Dokuwiki
=========================================

Please notice, that this is barely usable at the moment.
I made this for my own usei only, so the code is very very ugly.

The main idea is this:

git commit -m "Fixed a typo bug #bug24"

After committing, the wiki plugin will show commit messages and
convert "#bug24" into internal link to bug-page with correct anchor.

It also workd this way too:

git commit -m "Started working for login page (#ft4)"

The "#ft4" is transformed into internal link to features page and creating
hyperlink into #ft4 (you need bookmark-plugin for creating those anchors)

Just add this into wiki page:

<dokugitviewer:repository=my-repository-name features=backlog bugs=bugdb limit=15>

And it will build you a list of your latest commits

Requirements:
  Bookmark-plugin installed for Dokuwiki
  PHP5
  Git

Installation:
  1) Clone this repository into plugins/ directory in your dokuwiki directory
  2) Edit the config.inc.php file
  3) Add <dokugitviewer> link into your wiki page
