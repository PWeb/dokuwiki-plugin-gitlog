Git repository viewer plugin for Dokuwiki
=========================================

Please notice, that this is barely usable at the moment.
I made this for my own use, so the code is very very ugly.

The main idea is this:

git commit -m "Fixed a typo bug #bug24"

After committing, the wiki plugin will show commit messages and
convert "#bug24" into internal link to bug-page with correct anchor.

Also this works too:

git commit -m "Started working for login page (#ft4)"

The "#ft4" is transformed into internal link to features page also
anchoring into #ft4 (you need bookmark-plugin for creating those anchors)

Just add this into wiki page:

<dokugitviewer:repository=my-repository features=backlog bugs=bugdb limit=15>

And it will build you a list of your latest commits

Requirements:
  Bookmark-plugin installed for Dokuwiki
  PHP5
  Git
